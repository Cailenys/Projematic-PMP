# Projematic-PMP

DOCUMENTATION ON THE FUNCTIONALITY OF THIS WEBPAGE

Landing Page/Front/Main Page.
This is split into 3 main aspects, namely the header, flowchart section and the footer. 
Header/Navigation Bar
These houses the Projematic Logo, the Home, Service and Login buttons.
•	The HOME button is meant to be a refresher for the home page.
•	The SERVICE button is meant to give options for the services that is offered in terms of membership i.e. Basic and Premium services. These button however is not active given we were unsure of what level of membership is required.
•	The LOGIN button gives subscribed users access to the page where they can access services, templates, documents and other essential tools not generally available to visitors (none members).

The LEARN MORE button under each phase of the project life cycle, on clicking, gives a popup window with option of downloading templates/tools relevant for each phase in the project life cycle. However, given we do not have the templates, we decided to include in there the detailed flowchart of each phase. As such clicking each learn more button under each phase gives a popup window with downloadable flowcharts.

For the PAYMENT PAGE/SUBSCRIBE PAGE, we decided to keep it simple. Customers can enter their debit or credit card numbers, the expiry date (mm and year only in separate box/filed provided) and the 3-digit security code behind the credit/debit card.
Also, clients would enter their full name, email address and subscription fee, the amount depends on the membership level they are subscribing for. Once the details is entered, they submit by pushing the submit button.

The LOGIN PAGE is quite simple with only 3 fields required for clients/members to gain access to the details provided on the website via their membership status.
